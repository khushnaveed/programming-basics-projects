### JavaScript Basics Revision

---

#### **1. Working with Variables**
- Create variables to store your first name, last name, and your current city.
- Change the value of the city variable to a new city later in the code.
- Print all the variables to the console.

#### **2. Simple Arithmetic with Variables**
- Create two variables to store your current age and your friend’s age.
- Find the sum of both ages and store the result in a new variable.
- Subtract your age from your friend’s age and store the result in another variable.
- Print both results to the console.

#### **3. Using a `for` Loop**
- Create a `for` loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 15.
- Modify the loop to print only odd numbers between 1 and 15.
- Inside the loop, multiply each odd number by 3 and log the result to the console.

#### **4. Using a `while` Loop**
- Create a `while` loop that counts up from 1 to 20 and prints each number.
- Modify the loop to stop when the number reaches 13.
- Create another `while` loop that logs the numbers from 50 down to 25.

#### **5. String Manipulation**
- Create a string that contains a sentence about your favorite hobby (e.g., "I love playing basketball").
- Use string methods to:
  - Convert the entire string to lowercase.
  - Find and print the length of the string.
  - Extract the word "basketball" from the string (or the word of your hobby).
  - Replace the word "playing" with "enjoying".

#### **6. Basic Arrays**
- Create an array that holds the names of five of your friends.
- Perform the following actions:
  - Add a new friend to the end of the array.
  - Remove the first friend from the array.
  - Print the third friend in the array.
  - Print the length of the array.

#### **7. Looping through Arrays**
- Create an array of your five favorite foods.
- Use a `for` loop to print each food in the array.
- Modify the loop to print each food in uppercase.
- Use a `while` loop to print each food, starting from the last item going backwards.

#### **8. Ternary Operator**
- Create a variable that holds a number.
- Use a ternary operator to check if the number is positive or negative. Log "Positive" or "Negative" to the console.
- Create another ternary check to determine if a person’s age is below or above 21. If below, print "Not allowed" and if above, print "Allowed".

#### **9. Functions with Parameters**
- Write a function that takes two parameters, `firstName` and `lastName`, and returns the full name as a single string.
- Write a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum.
- Write a function that accepts a number as a parameter and prints all numbers from 1 up to that number using a `for` loop.

#### **10. Functions with Default Parameters**
- Write a function that accepts two numbers and a third optional parameter `operation` (default to "add"). If the operation is "add", return the sum; if it's "subtract", return the difference.
- Call the function for both "add" and "subtract" cases to see the results.

#### **11. Using `for` and `while` Loops Together**
- Write a function that uses a `for` loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.
- Inside the function, add a `while` loop that continues printing numbers until it reaches 20.
  
#### **12. More Practice with Arrays**
- Create an array of 10 numbers. 
- Use a `for` loop to calculate the sum of all numbers in the array.
- Use a `while` loop to print only the numbers greater than 5 from the array.

These tasks cover basic JavaScript concepts like variables, loops, string manipulation, arrays, and simple functions. Be sure to test and log your results in the console to track your progress!
