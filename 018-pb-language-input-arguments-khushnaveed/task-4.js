/* 
Same as Task 3, but this time the program should accept 3 arguments:

- a greeting
- a first name 
- a last name 

The output should be a short introduction message, for example:
```plaintext
> node task-4.js Hello Martha Blue 
Hello, my name is Martha Blue.

> node task-4.js Hi Rob Green 
Hi, my name is Rob Green.
``` 
*/

console.log(`${process.argv[2]}, my name is ${process.argv[3]} ${process.argv[4]}.`);
